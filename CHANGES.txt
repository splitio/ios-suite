2.2.0: (Jun 4, 2025)
- Added support for rule-based segments. These segments determine membership at runtime by evaluating their configured rules against the user attributes provided to the SDK.
- Added support for feature flag prerequisites. This allows customers to define dependency conditions between flags, which are evaluated before any allowlists or targeting rules.
- Added two new configuration options to control the behavior of the persisted rollout plan cache. Use `rolloutCacheConfiguration` in the config.
- Fixed performance issue evaluating flags.
